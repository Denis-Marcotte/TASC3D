Description

The program TASC3D checks the admissibility in 3D of multivariate models with symmetrical cross-covariances. Any number of variables and any number of components for each direct or cross covariance can be specified. Each component can be isotropic or present a geometric anisotropy. The program allows to let one or two parameters unknown. In this case, the user must provide a set of values for these parameters where the admissibility will be checked.

More details on its usage are given in the paper and its Appendix.
